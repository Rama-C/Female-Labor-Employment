##Explore and Summarize Data Analysis using R  

Analysis of Female labor force.

An analysis was performed to understand  the distribution of female employment among the three distinct employment categories, across countries and to study the change in distribution over the years.The female labor employment data is collected from www.Gapminder.org.

The desired data which is used for this analysis ,is obtained from three different files . 
   
The three files are 

  - Female salaried workers.This file describes the percentage of all female labor that earns a salary from working.
  
  - Female self-employed .This file describes the percentage of all female labor that works as self-employed workers.
  
  - Female family workers.This file describes the percentage of all female labor that works as contributing family workers.

```

The structure of salaried worker is shown below.

```{r}
# Processing of Female salaried workers
salaried_worker<-read.csv('salaried employee.csv', header = T)
names(salaried_worker)[1]<-"countries"
salaried_worker <-subset(salaried_worker, countries%in% all_info_countries)
names(salaried_worker)<-gsub("X","",names(salaried_worker))
str(salaried_worker)
salaried_worker$`1980`<-unfactor(salaried_worker$`1980`)
salaried_worker$`1981`<-unfactor(salaried_worker$`1981`)
salaried_worker$`1982`<-unfactor(salaried_worker$`1982`)

modified_salaried_worker<- melt(salaried_worker,variable.name='year',value.name='salaried_worker')

```
Each data file includes data from 153 countries all over the world  from the year 1980 to 2007.
  
  
The countries Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Korea,Rep., Norway, United Kingdom  and United States are being considered for analysing the data, as they have almost complete data for the years 1980- 2007 in all three categories  .

Each data file needs some sort of processing to proceed with our analysis. The column names needs to be changed and the datavalues corresponding to the year 1980,1981 and 1982 has to be converted from factor .
The structure of self_employed is shown below.


```{r}
# Processing of Female self-employed workers
self_employed<-read.csv('self employed.csv', header = T)
names(self_employed)[1]<-"countries"
self_employed <-subset(self_employed, countries%in% all_info_countries)
names(self_employed)<-gsub("X","",names(self_employed))
str(self_employed)
self_employed$`1980`<-unfactor(self_employed$`1980`)
self_employed$`1981`<-unfactor(self_employed$`1981`)
self_employed$`1982`<-unfactor(self_employed$`1982`)
```

The first five rows of self_employed are displayed.

```{r}
modified_self_employed<- melt(self_employed,variable.name ='year',value.name='self_employed')
head(self_employed,5)

```

The structure of service employ is shown below.


```{r}
# Processing of Female family workers
getwd()
family_workers<-read.csv(' Familyworkers.csv', header = T)
names(family_workers)[1]<-"countries"
family_workers <-subset(family_workers, countries%in% all_info_countries)
names(family_workers)<-gsub("X","",names(family_workers))
str(family_workers)
family_workers$`1980`<-unfactor(family_workers$`1980`)
family_workers$`1981`<-unfactor(family_workers$`1981`)
family_workers$`1982`<-unfactor(family_workers$`1982`)




modified_family_workers<- melt(family_workers,variable.name ='year',value.name = 'family_workers')

```

And then the data is converted to the required tidy form using melt.The three different files are combined together and thus becoming our desired dataset .

A new variable called "Year category " has been created .  This variable segregates each year into one of the categories  1980-1985, 1985-1990 , 1990-1995 ,1995-2000 and 2000-2007.The same data is analysed with the  year category variable as well.

The first five rows of our desired dataset are displayed .
```{r }
trial1 <- merge(modified_salaried_worker,modified_self_employed,by=c('year','countries'))
All_info <- merge(trial1,modified_family_workers,by=c('year','countries'))

All_info$year_cat <-cut(unfactor(All_info$year),breaks=c(1980,1985,1990,1995,2000,2007),
                        include.lowest = TRUE)
All_info$family_workers<-round(All_info$family_workers,1)
All_info$self_employed<-round(All_info$self_employed,1)
All_info$salaried_worker<-round(All_info$salaried_worker,1)

head(All_info,5)
write.csv(All_info, file = "female_workers.csv")
```

```

This scatterplot shows the distribution of salaried_worker vs year for all the countries .Each country is represented by a unique colour.As you can see, the salaried worker values above 80 are crowded and some of the data points are overlapping with other points. To see the patterns and datapoints clearly,it would be better to connect datapoints of a country with a line.

In this plot ,the slopes are better visible and could be easily compared with one another.

- Korea,Rep. , spain  and Japan have a high slopes showing the high rise of salaried workers over the years.

- The broken line connection on Belgium  indicates the missing datapoints for the corresponding years.

- United kingdom and canada show a slight down trend.

- Except United kingdom ,United states and canada ,all the other countries show a rising trend for salaried worker.

- Norway which was fourth top in the salaried worker values in 1980  has become the top in 2007 .

#Multivariate plots

The data needs to be  converted to long format to analyse the data through all categories of employment status.
The first five rows are displayed from the new dataset.
